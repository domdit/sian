This is a website for a Malaysian and Indonesian catering service. It is one of the first websites I made as a freelancer. 

Using the Flask framework, I created an extensive admin page in which the client has almost full control over all aspects of the website. They can update the menus, images, and text. Similarly, I used JQuery to make the menus drag-and-drop sortable. I also designed the logo.
